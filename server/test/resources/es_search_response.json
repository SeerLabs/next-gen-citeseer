Research\n1\n\fFixed Schema, Evolving Data\nR1 R2 R3 R4\nT1 T2 T3 T4\nModels a time-enabled relation as a sequence of\nrelations separated by transaction commitments over a\nconstant relation schema\nSchema Evolution\n(Multi-temporal)\nR1 R2 R3 R4\nT1 T2 T3 T4\nModels a time-enabled dynamic relation as a sequence\nof relations and relation schemas separated by\ntransaction commitments\nNow\nNow\n2\n\fSchema Evolution, Formalism\n<(R1, d1), (R2, d2), (R3, d3), … (Rk, dk)>\nEach pair (Ri, di) represents a “version”, a relation\nschema and a snapshot of the extent of the relation\nConsider two time points, i and i+1:\nIf Ri = R(i+1) and di = d(i+1), there is no change\nIf Ri = R(i+1) and di ≠ d(i+1), DML occurred\nIf Ri ≠ R(i+1), DDL occurred\nDDL Possibilities\n� Change domain of an existing attribute\n� Rename an attribute\n� Add a new attribute\n� Remove an existing attribute\n� Add a new empty relation\n� Remove an existing relation\n� Add/remove temporal column\n3\n\fSeveral Issues with Evolution\n� Schema Update\n� Storage\n� Query\nSchema Evolution: Schema\nUpdates\n� Schema updates can only add information\n� Effectively, the schema of an evolving relation is\nthe union of all columns ever seen by the\nrelation in its lifetime\n� Called a “completed schema”\n� May want to delete columns/add columns\nwith certain timespans\n� Delete a column, effective last week\n� Add a column for only a limited time\n4\n\fSchema Evolution: DDL\n� Add a new attribute\n� Create new attribute with interval [addTime,\nnow]\n� Remove an existing attribute\n� Give the attribute’s interval an end time\n� Add a new empty relation\n� Create new relation with interval [addTime, now]\n� Remove an existing relation\n� Give the relation’s interval an end time\nSchema Evolution:\nDDL, part deux\n� Change domain of an existing attribute\n� Create new attribute with old values translated into new\ndomain\n� Give new attribute interval [addTime, now]\n� Give old attribute an end time\n� Rename an attribute\n� Same as above\n� These are interesting because it is the same\nprocess as a DML update\n� Propagate values to new structure\n� Mark old and new structures with appropriate intervals\n5\n\fSchema Evolution: DDL\nExample\n� Start with Employee [1994, now]:\n� Name:String [1994, now]\n� Salary:Float [1994, now]\n� Dept:String [1998, now]\n� T: DateTime Interval [1994, now]\n� ADD COLUMN Degree:String\n� DROP COLUMN Dept\n� ALTER COLUMN Salary ALTER DOMAIN Integer\n� End with Employee [1994, now]\n� Name:String [1994, now]\n� Salary:Float [1994, 2006]\n� Salary:Int [2006, now]\n� Dept:String [1998, 2006]\n� Degree:String [2006, now]\n� T: DateTime Interval [1994, now]\nSchema Evolution: Storage\n� Standard relational storage counts on\nhaving a static schema for efficiency\n� Think “union-compatibility” for tuples\n� One possible option: store each schema\nversion in its own storage\n� As if each is its own table\n� Called “multi-pool”\n� Query processor must pull from all tables\n6\n\fSchema Evolution:\nSingle-Pool Storage\n� Keep all tuples in the same storage\npool\n� Assign to each column a timestamp\ninterval, just like each tuple\n� Assign to each relation a timestamp\ninterval as well\nSchema Evolution: Queries\nand Query Processing\nSELECT * FROM Employee\nSELECT Dept FROM Employee\n� Which columns are returned?\n� If Dept was deleted, would this query cause\na compile/syntax error?\n� If the domain of Dept was ever changed,\nwhich domain would the query processor\nconsider?\n7\n\fQuery Processing, Continued\n� In a multi-pool architecture, query\nprocessor must know from which\nrelations to draw data\n� One possibility: a “meta-relation”\n� Table of tables – all table versions that\ncorrespond with one table stored in one\nplace\nMore Query Processing\n� Which schema should we use?\n� Could use completed schema\n� Another option: allow user to choose schema in\nquery\n� TSQL2 gives the user an option to set the\nschema time\nSET SCHEMA VALID 2006\nSELECT * FROM Employee\n8\n\fYour Time Has Not Been\nWasted\n� Temporal extensions have been made\nto some major DBMS’\n� Some databases are built from the\nground up to accommodate time\n� Active research areas also still exist\n� But…\nSQL:2003\n� Apparently, Part 7 (SQL/Temporal)\nwas withdrawn from the standard prior\nto publication\n� Part 7 was recommended unanimously,\nbut the ISO board could not come to a\nconsensus about it\n� Implications?\n� Do implementations follow standards?\n9\n\fOracle 9g, 10g\n� Technology called “flashback” queries and\ndatabases\n� Uses system log to simulate rollback relations\n� New product in version 10g called “Workspace\nManager”\n� Adds valid and transaction times to relations\n� Some operations, such as enabling/disabling versions, are\ndone through stored procedures\n� Not TSQL2\nSELECT * FROM employees e WHERE WM_CONTAINS\n(e.wm_valid, WMSYS.WM_PERIOD(TO_DATE('01-01-\n1991', 'MM-DD-YYYY'), TO_DATE('01-02-1991', 'MM-DD-\nYYYY')) = 1;\nMicrosoft SQL Server:\nImmortalDB\n� Currently research-only\n� Instead of giving tuples an end time stamp…\n� Creates chains of tuples\n� An updated tuple is added to the end of a chain,\neffectively “deleting” the previous version\n� A delete operation adds a “delete stub”\n� Focus is on “as of” queries\nBegin Tran AS OF \"8/12/2004 14:15:20“\nSELECT * FROM MovingObjects\nWHERE Oid < 11 Commit Tran\n10\n\fLeverage Existing DBMS\nUsing Outside Product\n� Leverage transaction logs\n� LogExplorer from Lumigent over SQL\nServer\n� IBM DataPropagator over DB2\n� These products replicate the logs so\nthat, even when the DBMS cleans out\nthe log, that information is still around\nTimeDB\n� DBMS built from the ground up in Java\nto support temporal constructs\n� http://www.timeconsult.com/Software/\nSoftware.html\n� Uses a flavor of SQL that borrows\nideas from TSQL2, but with different\nsyntax\n11\n\fMADS - Modeling of Application Data\nwith Spatio-temporal features\n� Start with a normal database\n� Add spatial and temporal awareness\n� Add multiple-representation capability\n� Tool (MADSTRA) translates a MADS\nconceptual model into a logical model\non an existing DBMS or GIS system\nThe Punchline\n� All major DBMS vendors have some product or\nextension that provides temporal capabilities\n� None of them use TSQL2 directly\n� All of them employ the concepts that we’ve\nseen, and the constructs from TSQL2, if not the\nexact syntax\n� None of them are as clean as TSQL2\n� TSQL2 Reference:\n�
